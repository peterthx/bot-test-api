1. Install Homebrew (if not already installed)
 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"


2. Install Python via Homebrew
- brew install python@3.13

3. Install Robot Framework using pip
- pip3 install robotframework

Or if you want to ensure it's installed for the Homebrew Python specifically:
- python3 -m pip install robotframework


Optional: Install additional libraries
# For web testing with Selenium
- pip3 install robotframework-seleniumlibrary

# For API testing
- pip3 install robotframework-requests

# For database testing
- pip3 install robotframework-databaselibrary

Troubleshooting tips for M3 Macs
1.Ensure pip is up to date:
- python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

2.For PATH issues, you may need to add Python's bin directory to your PATH. Add this to your "~/.zshrc:"
export PATH="$(brew --prefix)/opt/python/libexec/bin:$PATH"
Using "nano source ~/.zshrc"  # or whatever config file you edited
after config : "source ~/.zshrc"  # or whatever config file you edited
